I'm **Kazuki Yabe**, a **master** student in **Computational Linguistics** at **Indiana University Bloomington**. My expected graduation would be May, 2020. Before comming to Indiana, I was in Canada for about 7 years completing my high school and university. I majored in **Computer Science** and **Linguistcs** at **Simon Fraser University**.

My home is in Koto-ku, which is located at the right edge of Tokyo facing Tokyo Bay. I grew up there until I moved to Canada. Many landmarks, such as Asakusa, Skytree, and etc., are accessible by bicycle so it is a good place to stay for visiting Tokyo. I really love the place and miss the great food. 

My academic interests include **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Syntax**, **Semantics**, **Phonology**, and **Phonetics**. I have taken some courses for these areas except Phonology and Phonetics, but I'm planning to take them in my last semester.

(My non-academic interests:golf, anime, comics, guitar)
